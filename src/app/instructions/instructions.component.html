    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1: Select the "Programming" tab.  As scientists, create a program for the robot using plain text triggers to allocate actions. Use your creativity to design actions and triggers that make the robot strong enough to progress across the board without crossing the goal line.</li>
      <li>Step 2: Select the "Game" tab. Once you've finished programming the robot, the game commences. Control the tanks using the button controls provided on the game screen. Coordinate your attacks to stop the robot before it reaches the nearby city.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective is to create a robot that is powerful but not too powerful. Aim for a dramatic and exciting game rather than an easy victory.

    <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
    <p>Remember, you can program "flaws" into your robot to weaken it and give it personality. Be imaginative and have fun as you work together to create the ultimate robot and save the city!</p>
